## Wallets

Binary (pre-compiled) wallets are available on all platforms at [https://vergecurrency.com](https://vergecurrency.com/#wallets).

> **Note:** **Important!** Only download pre-compiled wallets from the official Verge website or official Github repos.

> **Note:** For a fresh wallet install you can reduce the blockchain syncing time by downloading [a nightly snapshot](https://verge-blockchain.com/down) and following the [setup instructions](https://verge-blockchain.com/howto).

### Windows Wallet Usage

1. Download the pre-compiled software from the releases section here.
2. Install
3. In windows file explorer, open `c:\Users\XXX\AppData\Roaming\VERGE` (be sure to change XXX to your windows user)
4. Right click and create a new file `verge.txt`
5. Edit the file to have the following contents (be sure to change the password)

    ```
    rpcuser=vergerpcusername
    rpcpassword=85CpSuCNvDcYsdQU8w621mkQqJAimSQwCSJL5dPT9wQX
    rpcport=20102
    port=21102
    daemon=1
    algo=groestl
    ```

6. Save and close the file
7. Rename the file to `verge.conf`
8. Start the VERGE-qt program.
9. Open up VERGE-qt console and run `getinfo` (or `getmininginfo`) to verify settings.

> **Note:** You must re-start the wallet after making changes to `verge.conf`.

### MacOS Wallet

1. Download the pre-compiled macos software from the releases section here.
2. Double click the DMG
3. Drag the Verge-Qt to your Applications folder
4. Double click the Verge-Qt application to open it.
5. Go grab a :coffee: while it syncs with the blockchain

> **Note:** It may look like it is frozen or hung while it is indexing and syncing the blockchain. It's not. It's chugging away, but currently the UI doesn't give you a lot of feedback on status. We're working to fix that. Syncing takes a while to complete (ie. > 10 minutes or more) so just be patient.

> **Note:** If you want to change your configuration the file is located at `~/Library/Application\ Support\VERGE\VERGE.conf`. This isn't required by default.

### Unix Wallet

1. Compile using [Unix instructions](doc/build-unix.md).
2. The wallet GUI is in `./verge/src/qt` and the daemon in `./verge/src`.
3. **Optional** - the binaries to your favorite location. for use by all users, run the following commands:

    ```shell
    sudo cp src/VERGEd /usr/bin/
    sudo cp src/qt/VERGE-qt /usr/bin/
    ```

4. Run `./VERGEd` from wherever you put it. The output from this command will tell you that you need to make a `VERGE.conf` file and will suggest some good starting values.
5.  Open up your new config file that was created in your home directory in your favorite text editor

    ```shell
    nano ~/.VERGE/VERGE.conf
    ```

6. Paste the output from the `VERGEd` command into the VERGE.conf like this: (It is recommended to change the password to something unique.)

    ```
    rpcuser=vergerpcusername
    rpcpassword=85CpSuCNvDcYsdQU8w621mkQqJAimSQwCSJL5dPT9wQX
    rpcport=20102
    port=21102
    daemon=1
    algo=groestl
    ```

7. Save the file and exit your editor. If using `nano` type `ctrl + x` on your keyboard and the `y` and hitting enter. This should have created a `VERGE.conf` file with what you just added.

8. Start the Verge daemon again

    ```shell
    ./path/to/VERGEd
    ```

> **Note:** To check the status of how much of the blockchain has been downloaded (aka synced) type `./path/to/VERGEd getinfo`.

> **Note**: If you see something like 'Killed (program cc1plus)' run ```dmesg``` to see the error(s)/problems(s). This is most likely caused by running out of resources. You may need to add some RAM or add some swap space.

* [OS X Instructions](doc/build-osx.md)
* [Windows Instructions](doc/build-windows.md)


## Use [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com)

To use VERGE with Unstoppable Domains for sending coins using Web3 Domains (know more about [Unstoppable Domains here](https://unstoppabledomains.com)), use this command to start the app "./verge-qt --with-unstoppable".

## Developer Notes

### Modern C++ Migration

Verge Core is actively migrating to modern C++ standards and practices:

- **C++17 Standard**: Full adoption with selective C++20 features
- **Reduced Boost Dependencies**: Migrating to standard library equivalents
- **Smart Pointers**: RAII and memory safety improvements
- **Thread Safety**: Modern concurrency patterns with `std::mutex` and `std::atomic`

### Coding Standards

- Use `std::filesystem` instead of `boost::filesystem`
- Prefer `std::thread` over `boost::thread`
- Use `std::unique_ptr`/`std::shared_ptr` instead of raw pointers
- Apply `const` correctness and `noexcept` specifications
- Follow RAII principles for resource management

### Quick Build (Ubuntu/Debian)

```shell
# Install modern dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential cmake git \
    libssl-dev libevent-dev \
    libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev \
    libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-test-dev \
    libminiupnpc-dev libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 \
    qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools \
    libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler \
    libqrencode-dev libseccomp-dev libcap-dev

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE && cd VERGE
./autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-cxx17 && make -j$(nproc)
```

### Advanced Build with CMake (Recommended)

```shell
# Modern build approach
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)
```

> **Performance Tip**: Use `make -j$(nproc)` or `cmake --build . --parallel` to utilize all CPU cores.

> **Memory Note**: If you encounter memory issues, either add swap space or reduce parallelism with `-j2`.




### macOS Development

> **Requirements:** macOS 12.0+ (Monterey), Xcode 13.0+, Command Line Tools

#### Intel and Apple Silicon Support

```shell
# Install Homebrew dependencies
brew install cmake boost openssl libevent berkeley-db4
brew install qt5 protobuf qrencode miniupnpc

# For Apple Silicon Macs, you may need to specify paths
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE && cd VERGE
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-cxx17 --with-boost=/opt/homebrew
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

#### CMake Build (Recommended for macOS)

```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt5" \
    -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl"
cmake --build . --parallel $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

> **Apple Silicon Note**: Some dependencies may need explicit paths. Use `brew --prefix` to find installation directories.

### Windows Wallet

TODO. Take a look at [building/windows](./building/windows).

## Docker Images

Check out the [`contrib/readme`](https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE/tree/master/contrib/docker) for more information.

## Mining

### Solo mining

Instead of joining a mining pool you can use the wallet to mine all by yourself. You need to specify the algorithm (see below) and set the "gen" flag. For instance, in the configuration specify `gen=1`.

### Using different algorithms

To use a specific mining algorithm use the `algo` switch in your configuration file (`.conf` file) or from the command line (like this `--algo=x17`). Here are the possible values:

```
algo=x17
algo=scrypt
algo=groestl
algo=lyra
algo=blake
```

## TestNet

Here is a list of active testnet nodes:
* ddvnucmtvyiemiuk.onion (sunerok)
* uacxdw34wnfybshfjs6hxdfzwkqxs765peu4iyyakqnz2mqyvspubeqd.onion (dedicated testnet)
